# 🐧 randomOpenGLstuff

Welcome to **randomOpenGLstuff**! 🎨✨  
My playground for learning, experimenting, and having fun with OpenGL, GLFW, and all things graphics. 🚀

## What is this?
This repo is a collection of my OpenGL experiments.
It's messy obvi but its my stuff nonetheless so i love it <3

## Features

- Modern OpenGL (3.3+) with [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/) and [glad](https://glad.dav1d.de/)
- Batch rendering, shaders, and more!
- CMake-based build system for easy setup

# Huge note that i have not tested this on linux or windows, so its mac only rn
 huge shoutout to ChatGPT for helping me fixing these fuckass bugs! love OpenGL and Apple's half baked depreciated OpenGL implementation
 shoutout to my determination
